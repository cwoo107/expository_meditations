## Dogmatics: the accepted doctrines of the church

Acts 16:4 uses the term dogma when speaking of an ecclesiastical decision, furninshing a basis for the theological use of the term. Referring to those statements or formulations of doctrines of established trruths by the body of Christians which formulated them, and which are therefore clothed with authority. During the middle ages, the Roman Catholic church regarded dogma as "a revealed truth which has in some way been defined by an infallible teaching authority, and as such is proposed to the acceptance of the faithful." For them, such truths may be revealed through either scripture or tradition, but it is the churhc that declares it to be revealed and imposes it upon the church. Thus it is really made to rest on the authority of the church.

The Reformers, however, regarded dogmas as divine truths, clearly revealed in the word of God, formulated by some competent church body, and regarded as authoritative, because they are derived from the word of God. They did not however regard the dogmas as infallible.

A notable change came about through Schleiermacher, who, veering from the objective to the subjective in his conception of the source of dogmas, considered Christian experience as their source. He saw in them the intellectual expressions, authorized by the church, of the inner meaning of the religious experiences of the christian community.

Ritschilian theology pretends to be more objective in its conception of dogmas, but is actually just as subjective. It regards dogmas as the scientific affirmations of the faith of the church. That is, not the contents of this faith, but of that which is involved in it. In this representation, faith, the fide qua creditur (the faith with which one believes), becomes the source of dogmas, and is just as subjective as religious experience.

More recent theology has a tendency to recognize the objective character of dogmas. The fundamental redemptive acts of God, revealed in the bible, constitute the dogma, which is the foundation of the church. Doctrine is the interpretation of revealed dogma, and therefore not the foundation, but the product of the church.

Barth distinguishes between "dogma", singular, and "dogmas", plural. Dogma is a "church proclomation, so far as it really agrees with the bible as the word of God". And is not to be regarded as a doctrinal position, but as divine action as a call to action on mans part. Dogmas are the doctrinal propositions confessed by the church, which are deposited in the church symbols, with their relative authority. They do not constitute the object (dogma), but are only the expression of faith.

Dogmas are truths derived from the word, but deriving them from the word does not make them dogmas. There are no dogmas in the word, only the doctrinal teachings which they embody. These then become dogmas when they are formulated and adopted by the church. Religious dogmas then have three characteristics: their subject-matter is derived from scripture, they are the fruit of the reflection of the church, they are officially adopted by an ecclesiastical body.

For Rome, dogmas are not mere repetitions of scripture, but are careful, however human and therefore fallible, formulations of doctrines contained in the word. Schleiermacher, deriving dogmas from the Christian conciousness, or Christian experience, ceases to make statements of truth respecting God and his will, but it instead becomes mere expressions of the meaning of the experiences of man. Doctrine for him is a statement about our feeling, not about God. Ritschilian does not differ from this materially. While he wants to take account of the objective revelation of God in Christ, he interposes the faith of the church between this  revelation and the dogmatician. This faith includes knowledge, but the knowledge is practical and experiential rather than intellectual. Thus dogmas are not the object, but the expression of faith.

The Reformed however derives their subject matter from scripture. The Bible is Gods word. It furnishes us with a reliable interpretation of the redemptive acts of God. The bible does not contain domas, but does contain the doctrinal truths which they embody. Doctrinal propositions, which are not derived from this source, can never become ecclesiastical dogmas.
