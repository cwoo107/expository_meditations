Praise the Lord! Who builds up his people, gathers the outcasts from around the world, heals the brokenhearted by binding up their wounds. He is "abundant in power" that is he is all powerful. 

His "understanding is beyond measure" that is he is all knowing and wise. He "lifts the humble" and "casts the wicked to the ground" for he is just. His delight is therefore not in the strength or wisdom of man or any other being. For what can they add to his perfection? 

Nor does he take pleasure in man's labor, but "the Lord takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his steadfast love". For by his word he holds all things in order, the seasons, crops, and seas. By his word, he declared to us his law, under which we were justly condemned. And by his word, that is Christ Jesus himself, in whom all things were created and to whom all things are given, we are redeemed in His death and resurrection. Passing from death to life. 

In him we have the steadfast love of God, so fear the Lord and delight in His great love and mercy.
