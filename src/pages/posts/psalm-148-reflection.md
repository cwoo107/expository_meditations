All of creation sings praise to the Lord. "For he commanded and they were created" (v5). It was by his own will, apart from any compulsion, that he created all things. His will in power through his word brought all the heavens and earth into being. "And he established them forever and ever; he gave a decree, and it shall not pass away" (v6). By his word, he worked his will to create all things, and it is by his will through his word, a decree, that all things are sustained. Sustained by the grace of God working powerfully through his word, that is Christ. 

In Christ, who is the word (John 1:1), all things were created, and all things are being sustained. "His name alone is exalted" (v13). Furthermore, Christ is the horn that is raised up for his people (v14). He is the praise of the saints, and it is in him only that we may be called such.

So it is to Christ that we owe our being, it is by Christ that we are continually being sustained, and it is in Christ that salvation has come to us. This is by the will of the Father, whose will is powerfully working in us through the Holy Spirit for the sake of Christ, and to the joy of all the saints.
