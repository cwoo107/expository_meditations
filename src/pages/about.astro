        <h1>About This Blog</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Welcome to Expository Meditations, a space dedicated to my personal meditation of God's Word. Here, I share analysis, insights, and personal reflections on various passages from Scripture.</p>
            
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>This blog serves primarily as a personal journal of biblical study. I do not claim to be an expert. The opposite actually. I'm just a simple laymen sharing his thoughts.</p>
            <p> Everything presented here is a first draft, written in one sitting with no outlines or plans. 
                I typically just read the passage in question and then begin writting my thoughts as they come to me. 
                Some of these thoughts are in error and may be scratched with corrections upon further reflection, but I typically will leave them in as an example. </p>
